# SLGL Infrastructure Improvements Summary

## üö® Critical: QLDB Deprecation Notice

**AWS QLDB is completely deprecated and cannot be provisioned in new AWS accounts as of July 2024.** Existing customers can use QLDB until end of support on **July 31, 2025**, but new deployments of this project will fail due to the AWS::QLDB::Ledger resource type being unavailable.

**Impact**: This project cannot be deployed on new AWS accounts without significant architectural changes.

## üî¥ Critical Infrastructure Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. **Replace QLDB with Modern Alternative**

**Problem**: The core `AWS::QLDB::Ledger` resource is deprecated and unavailable for new accounts.

**Recommended Replacement**: Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL with audit capabilities
- **Why**: AWS officially recommends Aurora PostgreSQL as QLDB replacement
- **Benefits**: ACID transactions, JSON/JSONB support, built-in audit capabilities
- **Migration Path**: Available via AWS documentation

**Alternative Options**:
- **DynamoDB + DynamoDB Streams**: For maintaining NoSQL model
- **DocumentDB**: For document-oriented workloads
- **RDS PostgreSQL**: For simpler deployments

### 2. **S3 Public Access Security Considerations**

**Current Design**: Multiple S3 buckets configured with public read access
- `ExportJournalBucket` - **Intentionally public** for QLDB journal transparency
- `ObserverDeadLetterBucket` - Public for debugging/monitoring visibility
- `TestObserverStorageS3Bucket` - Test environment bucket
- `TestStateStorageS3Bucket` - Test environment bucket

**Security Analysis**:
- ‚úÖ **Design Intent**: Public access supports SLGL's transparency and auditability goals
- ‚ùå **Missing Controls**: No bucket-level encryption or access logging
- ‚ùå **Overly Broad**: Test buckets may not need public access
- ‚ùå **No Documentation**: Public access rationale not clearly documented


**Documentation Gap**: Add clear explanation of which data is intentionally public and why.

### 3. **IAM Over-Privileged Policies**

**Problem**: Multiple IAM policies use wildcard resources (`Resource: '*'`)
- Lambda execution roles have overly broad permissions
- Violates AWS IAM least privilege principle

## üü° High Priority Infrastructure Improvements

### 4. **Missing VPC Architecture**

**Problem**: Lambda functions run in AWS-managed default network
- No network-level security controls
- No VPC endpoints for AWS service calls
- Missing security groups and NACLs


### 5. **Lambda Security Configuration Gaps**

**Missing Security Features**:
- No environment variable encryption (KMS)
- No X-Ray tracing for observability
- No Dead Letter Queues for error handling
- No VPC configuration


### 6. **API Gateway Security Missing**

**Missing Features**:
- No throttling configuration
- No request validation
- No caching configuration
- No WAF protection

## üü¢ Medium Priority Infrastructure Improvements

### 7. **Monitoring and Observability**

**Current Gaps**:
- No custom CloudWatch metrics
- Basic log groups without structured logging
- No comprehensive alarms on critical resources
- No cross-service correlation

**Recommendations**:
- Implement comprehensive CloudWatch monitoring
- Add custom business logic metrics
- Set up proactive alerting
- Enable X-Ray distributed tracing

### 8. **Multi-AZ and Disaster Recovery**

**Current State**: Single-region deployment
- No multi-AZ configuration
- No cross-region backup strategy
- No automated failover mechanisms

**Recommendations**:
- Implement multi-AZ deployment for databases
- Use cross-region replication for critical S3 buckets
- Implement automated backup and recovery procedures

### 9. **Cost Optimization Issues**

**Current Inefficiencies**:
- Always-on provisioned concurrency (`ProvisionedConcurrentExecutions: 2`)
- Frequent QLDB exports every minute (`cron(0/1 * * * ? *)`)
- No S3 lifecycle policies
- Potentially oversized Lambda memory allocations
